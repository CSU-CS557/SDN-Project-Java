# CS 557: SDN Project Java Option
Student Code for the Java version of the SDN project

The instructions for the SDN Routing project are available [here](https://github.com/CSU-CS557/SDN-Project-Java/blob/main/MininetProject_Spring21.pdf). You will be implementing a shortest-path algorithm for a switched ethernet using SDN Openflow via mininet and floodlight on a pre-configured virtual machine containing the necessary programs and tools. All of the files are avialable in this repository, so you will want to clone this repository to your local computer. 

Floodlight is an SDN controller program written in JAVA.  You will need to modify this program to take a given network topology and send flow table entries to each of the switches in the router.  It is recommended you follow the tutorial (UPDATE).

You will not need an eclipse environment to complete this project.  A skeleton file is provided that you will modify to accomplish the task.  You can simply recompile the file with "ant" as you make changes. 

You have  3 weeks to complete the project.

Grading of the project is described in [Grading Scheme](https://github.com/CSU-CS557/SDN-Project-Java/blob/main/Grading%20Scheme.pdf).
